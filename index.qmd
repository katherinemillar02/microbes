## **Everything Microbial Analysis...**

Welcome! This site is designed to help you build a solid understanding of microbial analysis techniques from the beginning. With a focus on beta diversity methods, and visualisation techniques such as PCA and NMDS, looking through the key concepts and practical applications. Using real-world datasets, hopefully this can be used to help identify and interpret differences in microbial diversity with confidence.

This site will cover methods to calculate **Beta Diversity** in microbial communities, including commonly used metrics such as **Bray-Curtis** and **Jaccard**. It will also introduce key visualisation techniques for exploring differences in microbiome composition, such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)**.

 

## Covered Topics

-   [**Beta Diversity Analysis Methods**](qmds/beta.qmd): An overview of key techniques used to calculate beta diversity, including Bray-Curtis and Jaccard indices.
-   **Visualisation Methods**
      - [**PCA**](qmds/PCA.qmd): A guide to visualising microbial community differences using PCA. 
      - [**NMDS**](qmds/NMDS.qmd): A guide to visualising microbial community differences using NMDS. 
      
      
## Study Used: Darrington et al. (2022)

The study: [ "Characterisation of the symbionts in the Mediterranean fruit fly gut"](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000801)

This study investigated the gut microbiota of the Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitata*), a significant agricultural pest, to better understand its microbial associations. The researchers compared the gut bacteria of wild and laboratory-raised flies fed on various diets. They found that while diet strongly influences the gut microbiota, a single bacterium *Klebsiella michiganensis/oxytoca* ("Medkleb") was consistently dominant and notably resistant to antibiotics.

### Data Used on This Website
Throughout this website, we focus on data from the **wild-caught samples** in the study. Specifically, the researchers examined how different natural fruit larval diets influence the adult gut microbiome of Mediterranean fruit flies.

Newly emerged adult female flies (0–3 days old) were collected during the summer of 2014 from a range of fruit hosts:  

-   **Morocco**: Argan  

-   **Crete**: Apricots, Oranges, Grapefruits  

-   **Greece**: Peaches, Oranges, Tangerines

The flies were preserved in ethanol, transported to the UK, and dissected to isolate DNA from their guts. Their microbial communities were then analysed using short-read 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
