## About
I am Katie Millar and am currently a PhD student in Biological Sciences at the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/), UK.

I am  a student in **The Chapman Lab**, under the supervision of [Tracey Chapman ](https://www.traceychapmanresearch.com/) and [Philip Leftwich](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/).

My research focuses on insect-microbe symbioses, using the Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitata*), a major agricultural pest. I explore the interactions between the Medfly and its associated microbiota. My broader interests are in microbial communities, insect biology. data analysis, and computational modelling. 

## This site 
The main purpose of this site is to introduce key concepts and methods in community analysis, with a particular focus on microbial communities. While the techniques presented are applicable to general ecological data, my examples and explanations are geared toward microbial ecology, reflecting my research interests.
