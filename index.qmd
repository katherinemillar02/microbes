## About
I am currently a PhD student in Biological Sciences at the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/), UK.

I am currently a student in [Tracey Chapman’s Lab](https://www.traceychapmanresearch.com/) and am also supervised by [Philip Leftwich](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/).

My research focuses on insect-microbe symbioses, using the Mediterranean fruitfly (*Ceratitis capitata*), a major agricultural pest. Exploring the interactions between the Medfly and their microbiota. I am interested in the area of data analysis, computational modelling, microbial communities, and insect biology.
