## Microbial Analysis background:

Welcome! This website is designed to help you explore the world of microbial community analysis. Looking into key concepts such as diversity metrics — including alpha and beta diversity, and visualisation and ordination techniques like PCA, PCoA and NMDS. Showing how these work using published datasets, helping you apply these methods to look at meaningful patterns in microbial and community data.

#### **Why do we look at microbial analysis?** 

Understanding what’s in a microbiota and how it changes across environments is key to answering many ecological and biological questions.

 
**Microbial analysis reveals:**

-   What microbes are present
-   How communities vary across conditions
-   What factors shape these communities
 

#### **What can I learn on this website?**

This site introduces essential methods for calculating both **Alpha Diversity** and **Beta Diversity** in microbial communities. You'll explore widely used ecological metrics, including:

[**Alpha Diversity:**](qmds/alpha.qmd)

  - CHAO1  
  - Shannon’s Index 
  - Simpson’s Index

[**Beta Diversity:**](qmds/beta.qmd)

  - Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
  - Jaccard index

In addition to learning Alpha and Diversity metrics, you’ll learn how to visualise microbial community differences using multivariate techniques such as:

**Visualisation and Ordination Methods:**

 - [**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**](PCA.qmd)
 - [**Principal Co-Ordinate Analysis (PCoA)**](PCoA.qmd)
 - [**Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)**](NMDS.qmd)

These tools will help you identify and interpret variation in microbial composition with confidence.


 


## Data Used: Darrington et al. (2022)

Throughout this website, we use data extracted from a study looking at the microbiota compostion of the pest insect, the Medfly: 

["Characterisation of the symbionts in the Mediterranean fruit fly gut"](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000801)

This study investigated the gut microbiota of the Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitata*), a significant agricultural pest, to better understand its microbial associations. The researchers compared the gut bacteria of wild and laboratory-raised flies fed on various diets. They found that while diet strongly influences the gut microbiota, a single bacterium *Klebsiella michiganensis/oxytoca* ("Medkleb") was consistently dominant and notably resistant to antibiotics.


### Data Used on This Website

Throughout this website, we focus on data from the **wild-caught samples** in the study. Specifically, the researchers examined how different natural fruit larval diets influence the adult gut microbiome of Mediterranean fruit flies.

Newly emerged adult female flies (0–3 days old) were collected during the summer of 2014 from a range of fruit hosts:  

-   **Morocco**: Argan  

-   **Crete**: Apricots, Oranges, Grapefruits  

-   **Greece**: Peaches, Oranges, Tangerines

The flies were preserved in ethanol, transported to the UK, and dissected to isolate DNA from their guts. Their microbial communities were then analysed using short-read 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
