title: "DNA Extraction and Lysis"

Before we can analyse the data, before we can even sequence - we need to extract the DNA from our sample. 

Across microbial science, we might sequence from a number of samples. Some people use soil, feaces of birds, whole insect tissue or the dissected guts of insects just to name a few. 

The DNA extraction kit which one uses can make a considerable difference to your data. 


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(DT)

df <- read_excel("dnasequencing.xlsx")

datatable(
  df,
  options = list(pageLength = 100, scrollX = TRUE),
  caption = "My Excel Table"
)

```
