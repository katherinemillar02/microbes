Before we can analyse the data, before we can even sequence - we need to extract the DNA from our sample. 

Across microbial science, we might sequence from a number of samples. Some people use soil, feaces of birds, whole insect tissue or the dissected guts of insects just to name a few. 

The DNA extraction kit which one uses can make a considerable difference to your data. 

DNA yields are also of great importance to ensure yiu have sufficient DNA before it gets sent off for sequencing.
