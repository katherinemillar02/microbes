# What is Alpha Diversity?

Alpha diversity, is diversity **within** a sample. It how diverse or rich your microbiome sample is in terms of different microorganisms. 

Two important things are focused on: 

  - **Species richness**: the number of different species present in a sample. Abundance of species, nor their relative distributions are considered. 
  - **Species eveness**: a measure of relative abundance of different species that make up richness. 
  

#### **Common Alpha Diversity Metrics** 

 - CHAO1 Index
 - Shannon Index 
 - Simpson Index 
 
 
# CHAO1 Index 

The CHAO1 Index is a measure of **species richness**. This is employed to estimate the number of OTUs present in a sample. 



# Shannon Diversity Index 

The Shannon Diversity Index accounts for both how many species are present, and how evenly they are distributed. 

# Simpson Index
