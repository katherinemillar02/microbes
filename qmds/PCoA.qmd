**Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)**, also known as classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), although this is sometimes challenged - is another common ordination technique.

### What is PCoA? 

  - PCoA is used to analyse or visualise relationships between samples, based on their **pairwise distances** or **dissimilarities**. 
  - It reduces dimensionality, while preserving as much of the original structure as possible. 
  - Unlike [**PCA**](PCA.qmd), **PCoA** can be applied to **non-Euclidean distances**, such as [**Bray–Curtis**](beta.qmd#bray-curtis-dissimilarity) or [**Jaccard**](beta.qmd#jaccard-dissimilarity). This means it is more fleixble, and it does not have to satisfy any rules. 
  - The general goal of PCoA is to represent possible non-Eucledian distances with a set of Eucledian co-ordinates. 
  - Like most ordination methods, PCoA will project the pairwise distance samples into a co-ordinate system, where axes that best preserve the original distances are selected. Closely related samples cluster together, and dissimilar samples will spread further apart. 
  - The general principle is that this reflects is that *n* sample units can be illustrated in only one dimension! 




 
 
 

### How do we PCoA?

1. **Generate a distance matrix** 

 - A dissimilarity matrix is created from the original data. 
 - The matrix is centralised (to adjust it for eigen-decomposition). 
 
2. **Eigen-decomposition** 

 - The centralised matrix undergoes eigen-decomposition. 
 - Like PCA, The eigenvalues we generate represent the variance explained; eigenvectors define new co-ordinate axes (also like what we learnt in PCA)! 

3. **Select pricipal coordinates**
 - Coordinates corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are kept, as these are the best representation of the data. 
 
 4. **Project samples**  
 - Each sample is assigned coordinates in this reduced space, this is the visualisation. 
 
        
      
### PCA vs PCoA: 
  - PCoA is a special type of PCA, because it does not need Eucledian distances. 
  - PCA needs Eucledian distances. 
  - In PCoA, distance matrixes can be used..
