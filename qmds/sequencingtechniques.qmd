This section will take you through any sequencing techniques.

**Amplicon Sequencing**:
- Amplicon sequencing is a targeted DNA sequencing approach used to identify and compare specific genetic regions across many samples.
- There are different types, but for bacteria and archaea specifically, we use the 16S rRNA gene. 
- Within amplicon sequencing, there are two types: (i) short-read sequencing and (ii) long-read sequencing.

**An overview of how it works:**
1. DNA extraction from samples (e.g. gut, soil, feces, fruit, insect tissue)

Samples such as gut contents, soil, feces, fruit, insect tissue, etc, are first collected. DNA is extracted from these samples using a commercial DNA extraction kit or laboratory protocol. This process breaks open cells and isolates total DNA, which is then purified and stored in a solution (the DNA extract) for downstream analysis.






2. PCR amplification of a target gene region using primers that bind conserved sites

3. Indexing/barcoding so many samples can be pooled together

4. High-throughput sequencing (commonly Illumina platforms)

5. Bioinformatic analysis to infer taxonomic identity or genetic variation



**Shotgun Metagenomics**:
